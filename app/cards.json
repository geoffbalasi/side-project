     "tagline": "You don't know what you've got 'til it's...",
     "consensus": "Dark, intelligent, and stylish to a fault, Gone Girl plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike."

    {"name": "The Imitation Game",
     "tagline": "Behind every code is an enigma",
     "consensus": "With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, The Imitation Game serves as an eminently well-made entry in the \"prestige biopic\" genre."
    },
    {"name": "Taken 3",
     "tagline": "It Ends Here",
     "consensus": "Hampered by toothless PG-13 action sequences, incoherent direction, and a hackneyed plot, Taken 3 serves as a clear signal that it's well past time to retire this franchise."
    },
    {"name": "Selma",
     "tagline": "One Dream Can Change the World",
     "consensus": "Fueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, Selma draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Martin Luther King, Jr. -- but doesn't ignore how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied."
